      <h1>Recipe to make MOMO</h1>
      <h2>What is MOMO?</h2>
      <p>
    
    Momo is a dumpling made of all-purpose flour and filled with either meat or vegetables. Inspired by Tibetan dumplings, the dish is a very popular Nepali street food.
    <h3>Let's talk how Popular is MOMO</h3>Among the different varieties of Nepali food available, momo is one of the most popular items. In fact, momos are so popular in Nepal that almost every restaurant offers it on their menu. 
        It’s gaining so much popularity, so much so that guests often ask us for the recipe for our chicken, mutton, and vegetarian momos. Most of all Buff MOMO, made out of Buffallo meat.

 

    In Nepal the most common type of momos are buff (buffalo) momos followed by chicken. A few restaurants also offer special momos such as pumpkin momos or spinach & cheese momos but non-veg momos are still the favourite.</p>

      

      <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>500 gm of minced meat</li>
          <li>1 grated oniond</li>
          <li>Some finely chopped coriander</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each</li>
          <li>Half a tablespoon of coriander powdere</li>
          <li>Half a tablespoon of turmeric</li>
          <li>Half a tablespoon of cumin powder</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of grated chilli</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of salt</li>
          <li>1 kg of flour</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions to fillings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add 1 grated onion to the minced meat.
          </li>
         <li>Add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder. This is to add a bit of color to the meat.</li>
         <li>To enhance the flavor of the filling add 2 tablespoon of salt.</li>
         <li>Add 2 tablespoons of grated chilli. You can add a bit more if you want the momos to be spicy.</li>
         <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each.</li>
         <li>Add half a tablespoon of coriander pow
            <li>Mix the spices with the meat.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. The oil prevents the filling from getting too dry (Nepalese love momo with juicy fillings).</li>
            <li>Add finely chopped coriander.</li>
            <li>Mix them well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now onto the wrappers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="momo-wrappers">
        <p>Making wrappers is easier than making the fillings or even the cooking part and it’s fun too!</p>
        <li>Put the flour into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add water a little at a time to the flour to make dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for a few more minutes. This makes the dough easier to use.</li>
        <li>Pinch off a bit of the dough (the amount depends on how big you want the wrapping to be).</li>
        <li>With a rolling pin roll the dough as thin as possible into circular shapes (don’t make them too thin or too thick) the size of a glass.</li>
      </div>

      <div class="cooking">
        <h2>Cooking the momos</h2>
        <li>Put around one tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the wrapping.</li>
        <li>Pinch one edge of the wrapping to the other edge then twist it.</li>
        <li>Keep doing this until the filling is covered (make sure the wrapping fully covers the filling otherwise the momos may break when steamed).</li>
        <li>Oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents the momos from sticking.</li>
        <li>Put the momos in a systematic order so that they don’t touch each other.</li>
        <li>Steam for 20  30 mins.</li>

      </div>
      <p>Hot Tip!: Roll a large amount of dough then use a glass to cut out smaller wrappers. Steel glasses are best for this.</p>
      
      <p>After steaming, your momos are now ready to be served! Fresh momos taste the best, so have a few while you’re still waiting for others.</p>
      <div class="achar">
